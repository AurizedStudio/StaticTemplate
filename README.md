# Static Template

I use this template when I do web site cording from nothing.  
(using Bootstrap, Sass, Browsersync)

## Usage

First of all you have to do this.  

```
1. npm install  
2. npm run pre  
3. npm start  
```

To make sprite image:  
``gulp sprite``

To make webfont(iconfont):  
``gulp iconfont``

To delete unusing css selector:  
``gulp delselector``
